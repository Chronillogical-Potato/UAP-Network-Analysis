# UAP-Network-Analysis
Visualizes relationships and potential reactions between stakeholders regarding UAP phenomena using network graph analysis.

# UAP Reaction Network Analysis
This project simulates a network graph representing key stakeholders and their relationships surrounding disclosure and study of UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena). The visualization aims to map community structure and highlight areas of potential unknown reactions and variables.

The network graph models nodes as key stakeholder groups such as Government, Military, Scientific Community, Corporations, Media, and the Public. Edges between nodes signify relationship strength based on expected interactions around UAP issues. An interactive force-directed layout positions nodes based on edge weight. Community detection clusters nodes by connectivity.

The tool is implemented in Python using NetworkX, Matplotlib, and Plotly. Users can visualize emerging communities and drag nodes to test different configurations. Time series data can be overlaid to correlate with network patterns. The goal is to create an analytical decision-support tool for evaluating hypothetical scenarios and influencer responses.

Further development is planned to enhance interactivity, expand data integration, and refine layouts and algorithms. Contributions welcome!

# P.S. This project was collaboratively developed with the assistance of Claude, an AI assistant created by Anthropic. Claude provided critical thinking, code implementations, and documentation throughout the development process. The project creators gratefully acknowledge Claude's contribution as a co-creator.
